# K8s Tetris Scheduler
#### Author: Kyle Martin (kdmarti2)

This folder containers the source code and build environment of the Tetris scheduler.  Inorder to use the tetris scheduler it is recommend that a private docker repository is setup that is accessible to the Kubernetes deployment.  Also establishing portforwarding through ssh tunneling is recommended to push the tetris image to the docker private repository.  I recommend using the `LocalForward 4999 127.0.0.1:50000` command in your ssh config file that handles ssh connections to the private docker repository.
